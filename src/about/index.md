# About Me

My name is Frederic Marx. I plan, design, and build useful, focused, and fast websites with personality.

Small and medium clients hire me to create new websites and apps, update existing ones, or help them establish and maintain a consistent visual brand.

I also work with larger organizations, where I typically fill a code-driven design role, develop and execute UI concepts, or complement mixed teams of designers and engineers.

I believe in the web as a platform of social change. Working on the web is a privilege and I think itâ€™s important to give back to the community and make it easier for everyone to participate.

I want every website to be great. If you want your website to be great, too, I can help you with that. Just ask!
